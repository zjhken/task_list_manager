# task_list_manager

The backend is written in Rust.
The key component of the backend is my self-written Rust web framework called "Seafloor".
The motivation if this framework a more elegant API.


# How to build
Rust program need to be complied.
So firstly need to setup the Rust environment with the official standard way.

If you want to run it internally, there are guides for you can refer to.
I will not paste the link here to avoid some keyword.

# How to run.
I will build a binary for you for the backend.
And I've prepared a script for you to run in /src/bin/task.sh
run `./src/bin/tasks.sh -h` , it will show you how to use.
